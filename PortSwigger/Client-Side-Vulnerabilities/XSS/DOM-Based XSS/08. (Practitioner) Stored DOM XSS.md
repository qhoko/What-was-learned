# üíª Exploiting DOM XSS with Various Sources and Sinks

A website is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) if there is an executable path that allows data to flow from **source** to **sink**. In practice, sources and sinks differ in their properties and behavior, which affects exploitability and determines the necessary methods.

Additionally, the website's scripts might perform validation or data processing, which should be taken into account when attempting to exploit the vulnerability. There are numerous sinks relevant to DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. See the details in the list below.

---

## üéØ Sink `document.write`

The `document.write` sink works with `script` elements, so you can use a simple payload, such as:

```javascript
document.write('... <script>alert(document.domain)</script> ...');
```

### üîß Example Vulnerability

1. This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking function.
2. It uses the JavaScript function `document.write` to write data to the page.
3. The function is called with data from `location.search`, which can be controlled via the website's URL.

To solve this lab, perform an attack using cross-site scripting that triggers the `alert` function.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

In some cases, the content written by `document.write` includes surrounding context that must be considered in your exploit. For example, you may need to close existing elements before injecting your JavaScript payload.

## üß™ Steps to Exploit Stock Check Functionality

1. **Navigate to any product page** and observe the stock check functionality. In the code, note that JavaScript extracts the `storeId` parameter from the `location.search` source and uses it with `document.write` to create a new option in the `select` element:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/678c0b7f-52a7-451d-94e9-1c91bac53d97)

2. **Add the `storeId` parameter to the URL** and input a random alphanumeric string as its value:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e425dd17-87ef-46be-b89b-534869423a7e)

3. **Request this modified URL** and notice that your random string appears as one of the parameters:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4ed25f-f08a-4d4b-be3f-d078b07e4af2)

4. **Inject the following payload into the `storeId` parameter** to trigger `alert`:

   ```html
   <script>alert('eyes')</script>
   ```

---

## üéØ Sink `innerHTML`

The `innerHTML` sink does not accept `script` elements in modern browsers, and `onload` events in `svg` will not trigger. Therefore, you need to use alternative elements like `img` or `iframe`. Event handlers like `onload` and `onerror` can be used with these elements. For example:

```javascript
element.innerHTML='... <img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)> ...';
```

### üîß Example Vulnerability

1. This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the blog search functionality. It uses an `innerHTML` assignment that modifies the HTML content of a `div` element using data from `location.search`.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8240629b-031c-4a4b-be90-71d354028f4a)

2. Input the following payload in the search field:

   ```html
   <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
   ```

3. The `src` attribute value is invalid, which triggers an error. This invokes the `onerror` event handler, which calls the `alert()` function. As a result, the payload executes whenever a user's browser loads the page containing your malicious post.

## üéØ Sources and Sinks in Third-Party Dependencies

Modern web applications are typically built using a variety of third-party libraries and frameworks, which often provide additional functionality and capabilities for developers. It is important to remember that some of these can also act as potential sources and sinks for DOM XSS.

### DOM XSS in jQuery

If you are using a JavaScript library such as jQuery, pay attention to sinks that can modify DOM elements on the page. For instance, the `attr()` function in jQuery can modify attributes of DOM elements. If data is read from a user-controlled source, such as the URL, and then passed into the `attr()` function, it might be possible to manipulate the input value to trigger XSS. For example, here is some JavaScript that modifies the `href` attribute of a link element using data from the URL:

```javascript
$(function() {
	$('#backLink').attr("href",(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnUrl'));
});
```

You can exploit this by modifying the URL so that the `location.search` source contains a malicious JavaScript URL. Once the page's JavaScript applies this malicious URL to the link's `href`, clicking the link will execute it:

```html
?returnUrl=javascript:alert(document.domain)
```

### üîß Example Vulnerability

1. This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the feedback page. It uses the jQuery `$` selector function to locate a link element and modifies its `href` attribute using data from `location.search`.

2. Navigate to the "Submit Feedback" form:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7ddb6cb-0a54-4d38-b3d7-acedc3a4eae5)

3. In the URL, locate the parameter `?returnPath=/` and change `/` to any random value, such as `eyes`:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2517ec0-015a-48ff-9905-c9ad91648f9e)

4. Inspect the element and note that your random value is passed into the `href` attribute:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328947fc-2532-44f8-8f13-8038b43e9f41)

5. Modify the `returnPath` parameter to:

   ```html
   javascript:alert(document.cookie)
   ```

6. Click the "< Back" link to execute the payload.

## üéØ DOM XSS Combined with Reflected and Stored Data

Some purely DOM-based vulnerabilities are confined to a single page. If a script reads some data from the URL and writes it to a dangerous sink, the vulnerability is entirely client-side.

This lab demonstrates a reflected DOM vulnerability. Reflected DOM vulnerabilities occur when a server-side application processes data from a request and outputs it in a response. Then, a script on the page processes the reflected data insecurely, eventually writing it to a dangerous sink.

### üîß Example Vulnerability

To solve this lab, create an injection that triggers the `alert()` function.

1. Connect Burp and enter any value in the search field.

2. In **Proxy -> HTTP History**, observe a request to `/resources/js/searchResults.js` and note that your string is reflected in the JSON response under `search-results`:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bf94972-1f57-4934-ad7a-e2616ce6ff4c)

3. Open the `searchResults.js` file in the site map and note that the JSON response is processed with an `eval()` function call:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b33a19f-82c4-48ce-917f-32be39e5270c)

4. Experimenting with different search strings reveals that the JSON response escapes quotes, but a single backslash is not escaped.

5. To solve this lab, enter the following search query:

   ```html
   \"-alert(1)}//
   ```

   Since you inserted a backslash and the site does not escape it, when the JSON response attempts to escape the opening double-quote character, it adds another backslash. The resulting double backslash effectively cancels out escaping. This means the double-quote character is processed without escaping, closing the string that was meant to contain the search query.

   Then, an arithmetic operator (in this case, the subtraction operator) is used to separate expressions before calling the `alert()` function. Finally, a closing curly brace and double slashes terminate the JSON object early and comment out what would have been the remainder of the object. The resulting response is as follows:

   ```json
   {"searchTerm":"\\\"-alert(1)}//", "results":[]}
   ```

## üéØ Stored DOM XSS in Blog Comments

Websites may also store data on the server and reflect it elsewhere. In stored DOM XSS vulnerabilities, the server receives data from one request, stores it, and then includes the data in a later response. A script in the later response contains a sink that processes the data insecurely.

For example:

```javascript
element.innerHTML = comment.author
```
