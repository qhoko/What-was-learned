## ‚ùì What is DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)?

DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities typically occur when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controlled source, such as a URL, and sends it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as `eval()` or `innerHTML`. This allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, which often enables them to hijack other users' accounts.

To exploit a DOM XSS vulnerability, data must flow from a source to a sink in a way that triggers the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

The most common source of DOM XSS is the URL, usually accessed via the `window.location` object. An attacker can craft a link to direct a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string or URL fragments. In some cases, such as on 404 pages or PHP-based websites, the payload can also be placed in the path.

For a detailed description of data flows between sources and sinks, see [DOM-Based Vulnerabilities](#).

## üîç Testing HTML Sinks

To test for DOM XSS in HTML sinks:

1. Insert a random alphanumeric string into the source (e.g., `location.search`).
2. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML and find where your string appears.
   - Important: The browser's "View Source" option is not suitable for DOM XSS testing, as it does not reflect changes made by JavaScript.
   - In Chrome Developer Tools, use `Ctrl+F` (or `Command+F` on macOS) to search for your string in the DOM.

3. For each location where your string appears in the DOM:
   - Identify the context.
   - Refine the input to understand how it is processed. For example, if the string appears in an attribute enclosed in double quotes, try inserting double quotes to see if you can break out of the attribute.

4. Note that browsers handle URL encoding differently:
   - Chrome, Firefox, and Safari encode `location.search` and `location.hash`, whereas IE11 and Microsoft Edge (pre-Chromium) do not.
   - If data is encoded before processing, an XSS attack is unlikely to succeed.

## üî¨ Testing JavaScript Execution Sinks

Testing JavaScript sinks for DOM XSS is more complex. Input may not appear in the DOM, requiring the use of a JavaScript debugger to trace data processing.

1. For each potential source (e.g., `location`):
   - Search for references to the source in the page's JavaScript code using Chrome Developer Tools (`Ctrl+Shift+F` or `Command+Alt+F` on macOS).

2. When you find where the source is read:
   - Add a breakpoint in the debugger and trace how the source's value is used.
   - Monitor variables assigned the source's value and look for their use in sinks.

3. When you find a sink receiving data from the source:
   - Check the variable's value in the debugger by hovering over it to see the data passed to the sink.
   - Refine the input to test if an XSS attack is successful.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing DOM XSS Using DOM Invader

Detecting and exploiting DOM XSS in real-world scenarios can be time-consuming, requiring manual analysis of complex, minified JavaScript. However, if you are using the Burp browser, you can leverage the built-in DOM Invader extension, which automates much of the work.

For details, see the [DOM Invader Documentation](#).

## üí° Tips for Preventing DOM XSS

1. **Minimize the use of dangerous sinks**:
   - Avoid using `eval()`, `innerHTML`, and similar constructs. Use safe alternatives like `textContent` or `setAttribute` instead.

2. **Sanitize input data**:
   - Validate input on both the server and client sides. Use whitelists of allowed values.

3. **Encode output data**:
   - For HTML contexts, use encoding functions like `encodeURIComponent` or specialized libraries.

4. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement a strict CSP to restrict JavaScript execution to trusted sources.

5. **Conduct regular security testing**:
   - Use automated scanning tools and manual testing to identify XSS vulnerabilities.

6. **Educate developers**:
   - Raise awareness among your team about XSS risks and prevention techniques.
