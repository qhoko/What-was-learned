## ‚ùì What is DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)?

DOM-Based XSS vulnerabilities typically occur when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controlled source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as `eval()` or `innerHTML`. This allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, often enabling them to compromise other users' accounts.

To exploit a DOM XSS vulnerability, data must be placed into a source in such a way that it propagates to a sink, triggering the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

The most common source of DOM XSS is the URL, typically accessed through the `window.location` object. Attackers can craft a link to direct a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string or fragment parts of the URL. In certain cases, such as targeting 404 pages or PHP-based websites, the payload can also be placed in the path.

For a detailed explanation of how data flows between sources and sinks, see [DOM-Based Vulnerabilities](#).

## üîç Testing HTML Sinks

To test for DOM XSS in HTML sinks:

1. Insert a random alphanumeric string into a source (e.g., `location.search`).
2. Use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML and locate where your string appears.
   - Note: The browser's "View Source" option will not work for DOM XSS testing, as it does not account for changes made to the HTML by JavaScript.
   - In Chrome Developer Tools, use `Ctrl+F` (or `Command+F` on macOS) to search for your string in the DOM.

3. For each location where your string appears in the DOM:
   - Determine the context.
   - Refine your input to understand how it is processed. For example, if your string appears in an attribute enclosed in double quotes, try inserting double quotes into your input to see if you can break out of the attribute.

4. Note that browsers handle URL encoding differently:
   - Chrome, Firefox, and Safari encode `location.search` and `location.hash`, whereas IE11 and Microsoft Edge (pre-Chromium) do not.
   - If data is URL-encoded before processing, an XSS attack is unlikely to succeed.

## üî¨ Testing JavaScript Execution Sinks

Testing JavaScript sinks for DOM XSS is more complex. Inputs may not appear in the DOM, requiring the use of a JavaScript debugger to trace how inputs are processed.

1. For each potential source (e.g., `location`):
   - Search for references to the source in the page's JavaScript code using Chrome Developer Tools (`Ctrl+Shift+F` or `Command+Alt+F` on macOS).

2. Once you locate where the source is read:
   - Add a breakpoint in the debugger and trace how the source value is used.
   - Track variables assigned the source value and check how they are used in sinks.

3. When you find a sink receiving data from a source:
   - Inspect the variable's value using the debugger by hovering over it to see the data before it reaches the sink.
   - Refine your input to determine if you can perform a successful XSS attack.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing DOM XSS with DOM Invader

Finding and exploiting DOM XSS in real-world scenarios can be tedious, often requiring manual analysis of complex, minified JavaScript. However, if you use the Burp browser, you can leverage its built-in DOM Invader extension, which automates much of the heavy lifting.

For more details, see [DOM Invader Documentation](#).

## üí° Tips for Preventing DOM XSS

1. **Minimize the Use of Dangerous Sinks**:
   - Avoid using `eval()`, `innerHTML`, and similar constructs. Instead, use safe alternatives like `textContent` or `setAttribute`.

2. **Filter Input Data**:
   - Validate input data on both the server and client sides. Use whitelists of allowed values.

3. **Encode Data on Output**:
   - For HTML contexts, use encoding functions like `encodeURIComponent` or specialized libraries.

4. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Set up a strict CSP to restrict JavaScript execution to trusted sources.

5. **Conduct Regular Security Tests**:
   - Use automated scanning tools and manual testing to identify XSS vulnerabilities.

6. **Educate Developers**:
   - Raise awareness among team members about XSS risks and prevention techniques.
