# ðŸ’» Exploiting DOM XSS with Various Sources and Sinks

A website is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) if there is an executable path that allows data to flow from a **source** to a **sink**. In practice, sources and sinks differ in their properties and behavior, which affects exploitability and determines the necessary methods.

Additionally, the website's scripts might perform validation or data processing, which should be taken into account when attempting to exploit the vulnerability. There are numerous sinks relevant to DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. See the details in the list below.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Sink `document.write`

The `document.write` sink works with `script` elements, so you can use a simple payload, such as:

```javascript
document.write('... <script>alert(document.domain)</script> ...');
```

### ðŸ”§ Example Vulnerability

1. This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking function.
2. It uses the JavaScript function `document.write` to write data to the page.
3. The function is called with data from `location.search`, which can be controlled via the website's URL.

To solve this lab, perform an attack using cross-site scripting that triggers the `alert` function.

## ðŸ§ª Steps to Exploit

1. **Enter a random string into the search field:**

2. **Inspect the element:**

   - Right-click on the field.
   - The random string is placed inside the `img src` attribute:

3. **Escape the `img` attribute using the following payload:**

   ```html
   "><svg onload=alert(1)>
   ```

## ðŸš€ Exploitation Tips

- Ensure that the payload is correctly injected into the HTML structure.
- Use the browser's developer tools to analyze the DOM and confirm the vulnerability.
- Experiment with different sinks to find the most effective method.
