# 💻 XSS: How to Prove and Exploit Vulnerabilities

## 🛠️ Traditional Method for XSS Testing

The traditional way to prove that you have found a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is by creating a popup window using the `alert()` function.

> 💡 **Note**: This is not because XSS is specifically related to popups; it is simply a way to prove that you can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a given domain.

### Example:
```javascript
alert("XSS vulnerability found!");
```

📌 Some use `alert(document.domain)` to explicitly show the domain where the JavaScript is executed:
```javascript
alert(document.domain);
```

## 🔐 Advanced Proof of XSS Vulnerabilities

Sometimes, you need to go further and prove that an XSS vulnerability poses a real threat. To do this, you can provide a full exploit.

### 🔎 In this section:
We will explore three of the most popular and powerful ways to exploit XSS vulnerabilities:

1. **Cookie Theft** 🍪
   - A method for session hijacking via JavaScript.

2. **Website Defacement** 🎨
   - Manipulating the DOM to alter the website interface.

3. **Executing Malicious Code** 🐍
   - Running complex scripts that lead to system compromise.
