## üõ†Ô∏è How Does AngularJS CSP Bypass Work?

Content Security Policy (CSP) bypasses function similarly to standard sandbox escapes but typically involve some HTML injection. When CSP mode is active in AngularJS, it processes template expressions differently and avoids using the `Function` constructor. This means that the standard sandbox escape described earlier will no longer work.

Depending on the specific CSP policy, JavaScript events may be blocked. However, AngularJS defines its own events that can be used instead. Inside an event, AngularJS provides a special `$event` object, which references the browser's event object. You can use this object to bypass CSP. In Chrome, there is a special property of the event object, `$event.path`, which contains an array of objects that trigger the event. The last property is always the `window` object, which can be used to escape the sandbox. By passing this array to the `orderBy` filter, you can iterate through it and use the last element (the `window` object) to execute a global function, such as `alert()`. The following code demonstrates this:

```html
<input autofocus ng-focus="$event.path|orderBy:'[].constructor.from([1],alert)'">
```

Note that the `from()` function is used to convert an object into an array and call a specified function (provided as the second argument) for each element of this array. In this case, we call the `alert()` function. We cannot call the function directly because the AngularJS sandbox will parse the code and detect that the `window` object is being used to invoke the function. Using the `from()` function instead effectively hides the `window` object from the sandbox, allowing us to inject malicious code.

### CSP Bypass with AngularJS Sandbox Escape

In the following lab, there is a length restriction, so the vector above will not work. To solve the lab, you need to devise alternative ways to hide the `window` object from the AngularJS sandbox. One way to achieve this is by using the `array.map()` function as follows:

```javascript
[1].map(alert)
```

The `map()` function takes a function as an argument and calls it for each element of the array. This bypasses the sandbox because the reference to the `alert()` function is used without explicitly specifying the `window` object. To solve the lab, try different ways to execute `alert()` without triggering AngularJS detection of the `window` object.

### Solving the Lab

This lab uses CSP and AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform an XSS attack that bypasses CSP, escapes the AngularJS sandbox, and triggers an alert displaying `document.cookie`.

1. Go to the exploit server and insert the following code, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab's identifier:

   ```html
   <script>
   location='https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cinput%20id=x%20ng-focus=$event.composedPath()|orderBy:%27(z=alert)(document.cookie)%27%3E#x';
   </script>
   ```

2. Click "Save" and "Deliver Exploit to Victim."

### Explanation of the Exploit

The exploit uses the `ng-focus` event in AngularJS to create a focus event that bypasses CSP. It also uses `$event`, which is an AngularJS variable referencing the event object. The `path` property is specific to Chrome and contains an array of elements that triggered the event. The last element in the array contains the `window` object.

Normally, `|` is a bitwise OR operation in JavaScript, but in AngularJS, it denotes a filter operation, in this case, the `orderBy` filter. The colon denotes an argument sent to the filter. In the argument, instead of directly calling the `alert` function, we assign it to the variable `z`. The function is called only when the `orderBy` operation reaches the `window` object in the `$event.path` array. This allows it to be invoked in the global scope without explicitly referencing the `window` object, effectively bypassing AngularJS's `window` check.

### Code Breakdown

#### `<input id=x ng-focus=$event.composedPath()|orderBy:'(z=alert)(document.cookie)'>#x';`

- **`<input id=x`**: This is an HTML input element with the ID `x`. The element will be activated (e.g., when focused).
- **`ng-focus`**: An AngularJS directive that binds the focus event to a specific expression. Here, it triggers code when the element is activated.
- **`$event.composedPath()`**: A method that returns the event path. It creates an array with DOM objects affected by the event.
- **`|orderBy:'(z=alert)(document.cookie)'`**: AngularJS syntax for applying filters. In this case, the filter is used to inject JavaScript code that calls `alert()` with the contents of `document.cookie`.
- **`#x';`**: Ends the string, adding a fragment or parameter to complete the expression.
