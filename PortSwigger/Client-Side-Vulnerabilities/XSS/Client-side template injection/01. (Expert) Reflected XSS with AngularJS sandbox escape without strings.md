## üõ†Ô∏è Crafting Advanced AngularJS Sandbox Escapes

So, you've learned how basic sandbox escapes work, but you might encounter websites with stricter controls on allowed characters. For example, a site might forbid the use of single or double quotes. In this situation, you'll need to use functions like `String.fromCharCode()` to generate your characters. Although AngularJS prevents direct access to the `String` constructor within an expression, you can bypass this by using the string's constructor property. Clearly, this requires a string to begin with, so you‚Äôll need to find a way to create a string without using single or double quotes.

In a standard sandbox escape, you would use `$eval()` to execute your JavaScript payload, but in the lab below, the `$eval()` function is undefined. Luckily, we can use the `orderBy` filter instead. The typical syntax for the `orderBy` filter looks like this:

```javascript
[123] | orderBy:'Some string'
```

Note that the `|` operator has a different meaning than in JavaScript. Normally, this represents a bitwise OR operation, but in AngularJS, it denotes a filter operation. In the code above, we are sending the array `[123]` on the left to the `orderBy` filter on the right. The colon denotes an argument to pass to the filter, which in this case is a string. The `orderBy` filter is typically used to sort an object, but it also accepts expressions, meaning we can use it to pass a payload.

### Solving the Lab

In this lab, AngularJS is used in an unusual way where the `$eval()` function is unavailable, and you cannot use any strings in AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform an XSS attack that escapes the "sandbox" and executes the `alert` function without using `$eval()`.

1. Navigate to the following URL, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab‚Äôs identifier:

   ```
   https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=1&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt%3d[].join;[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)=1
   ```

### Explanation of the Exploit

This exploit uses `toString()` to create a string without using quotes. It then accesses the `String` prototype and overwrites the `charAt` function for every string. This effectively breaks the AngularJS sandbox. Then, an array is passed to the `orderBy` filter. We set the filter's argument by again using `toString()` to create a string and the `String` constructor property. Finally, we use the `fromCharCode` method to generate our payload by converting character codes into the string `x=alert(1)`. Since the `charAt` function was overwritten, AngularJS allows this code, which it would normally block.

### Code Breakdown

#### `&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt=[].join;`

- **`&`**: Commonly used as a separator in URL parameters, but in this context, it‚Äôs part of the payload or structure.
- **`toString()`**: Calls the `toString` method, likely on a string or another object containing this method.
- **`constructor`**: Accesses the constructor of the object, allowing access to its prototype.
- **`prototype.charAt`**: Overwrites the `charAt` method on the string prototype, redirecting it to `[].join`.
- **`[].join;`**: Defines the new behavior for `charAt`, concatenating array elements into a string.

This effectively redefines how `charAt` works, allowing manipulation of string handling.

#### `[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)=1`

- **`[1]`**: An array with a single element, possibly used as a temporary data structure.
- **`|`**: The AngularJS filter operator.
- **`orderBy:`**: The `orderBy` filter, typically used for sorting but repurposed here for payload injection.
- **`toString().constructor.fromCharCode(...)`**: Calls the `fromCharCode` method to create a string from Unicode character codes:
  - `120` ‚Üí `x`
  - `61` ‚Üí `=`
  - `97` ‚Üí `a`
  - `108` ‚Üí `l`
  - `101` ‚Üí `e`
  - `114` ‚Üí `r`
  - `116` ‚Üí `t`
  - `40` ‚Üí `(`
  - `49` ‚Üí `1`
  - `41` ‚Üí `)`

  This generates the string `x=alert(1)`.

- **`=1`**: Assigns or evaluates the payload to ensure execution.

### Final Notes

This advanced technique demonstrates how AngularJS‚Äôs sandbox can be bypassed even with restrictions on character usage and unavailable functions. By exploiting how AngularJS processes filters and expressions, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript payloads.
