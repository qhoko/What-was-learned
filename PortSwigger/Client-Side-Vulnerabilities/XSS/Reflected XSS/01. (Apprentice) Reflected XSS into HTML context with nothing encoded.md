## 🧪 Lab: Simple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

⚠️ This lab demonstrates a simple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search function.

✅ To solve the lab, perform an XSS attack that triggers the `alert` function.

### 🔍 Steps to Complete:

1. You are greeted by a search form and posts:

2. Entering a value in the search form and clicking the "Search" button shows that the value is passed to the URL as `/search=<value>`:

3. 🚀 Try injecting a simple XSS payload into the search input: `<script>alert('eyes')</script>`

The resulting request looks as follows:

```
/?search=<script>alert('eyes')</script>
```

💥 Due to the lack of protection, the payload executes successfully, solving the lab:
