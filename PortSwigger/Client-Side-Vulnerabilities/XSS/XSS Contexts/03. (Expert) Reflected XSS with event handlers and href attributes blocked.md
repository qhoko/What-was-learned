## ðŸ§ª Lab: Using SVG to Execute XSS

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some tags whitelisted, but all events and `href` attributes are blocked.

To solve the lab, perform an XSS attack that injects a vector, which, when clicked, triggers the `alert()` function.

> **Note:** Your vector must be labeled with the word "Click" to encourage the simulated lab user to click it. For example:

```html
<a href="">Click me</a>
```

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the following URL, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab identifier:

    ```
    https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Csvg%3E%3Ca%3E%3Canimate+attributeName%3Dhref+values%3Djavascript%3Aalert(1)+%2F%3E%3Ctext+x%3D20+y%3D20%3EClick%20me%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fa%3E
    ```

    This injection uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to execute JavaScript code and looks as follows:

    ```html
    <svg>
        <a>
            <animate attributeName="href" values="javascript:alert(1)"/>
            <text x="20" y="20">Click me</text>
        </a>
    </svg>
    ```

2. **Injection Breakdown:**

    - **`<svg>`**: Defines the SVG container for scalable vector graphics. Browsers support SVG and often don't block its use in XSS contexts.
    - **`<a>`**: Creates a link element. Here, it's used to enclose the animation and text.
    - **`<animate>`**: An SVG-specific tag used to animate element attributes. In this case, it modifies the `href` attribute.
      - `attributeName="href"`: Specifies the attribute to animate.
      - `values="javascript:alert(1)"`: Sets the `href` value to `javascript:alert(1)`, enabling JavaScript execution when activated.
    - **`<text>`**: Displays "Click me" at coordinates (20, 20) within the SVG container.

3. **How It Works:**

    - When the user clicks "Click me," the animation triggers, changing the `href` attribute to `javascript:alert(1)`, which executes the JavaScript code.

4. **Why It Works:**

    - **Bypassing Blocking Policies:** Standard `href` attributes might be blocked by XSS protections, but SVG and animations are not typical event handlers and can bypass such restrictions.
    - **Dynamic Attribute Assignment:** The `<animate>` tag dynamically sets the `href` value, making it a unique XSS vector.

By following these steps, you will successfully execute the payload and trigger the `alert()` function when the simulated lab user interacts with your injected vector.
