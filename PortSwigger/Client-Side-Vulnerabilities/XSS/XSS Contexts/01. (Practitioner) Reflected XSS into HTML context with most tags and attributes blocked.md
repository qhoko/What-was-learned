## ðŸ§ª Lab: Bypassing WAF to Exploit Reflected XSS

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search functionality, but it uses a web application firewall (WAF) to block common XSS vectors.

To solve the lab, perform an XSS attack that bypasses the WAF and triggers the `print()` function.

> **Note:** Your solution must not require any user interaction. Manually triggering `print()` in your own browser will not solve the lab.

### Steps:

1. Enter `<>` into the search bar and submit. Observe that this input is blocked. Use Burp Intruder to identify which tags and attributes are blocked.

2. Enable Burp, enter any value into the search bar, and in **Proxy -> HTTP History**, send the request to **Intruder**. Replace the `search?=` parameter value with `<>`, and click **Add Â§** between the angle brackets:

3. Visit the [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and copy the tags to your clipboard.

4. Paste the tags into the **Payload configuration** section of Burp Intruder and click **Paste**:

5. Click **Start Attack**. Once the attack is complete, review the results. Note that most payloads result in a `400` response, but the `body` payload triggers a `200` response:

6. Return to Burp Intruder and replace the search query with `<body%20=1>`. Place the cursor before the `=` symbol and click **Add Â§** to create a payload position. The search term should now look like this: `<body%20Â§Â§=1>`.

7. Visit the [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and copy the events to your clipboard.

8. Repeat step 4, clearing previous payloads with the **Clear** button.

9. After the attack completes, review the results. Note that most payloads result in a `400` response, but some payloads result in a `200` response.

10. Use the `onresize` event to trigger the function on window resize.

11. Go to the exploit server and insert the following payload into the **Body**:

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://your.lab.url.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print(document.cookie)%3E" onload=this.style.width='100px'>
    ```

12. Click **View exploit** to verify the attack. An alert should appear.

13. Return to the exploit server, click **Store** to save the exploit, and then click **Deliver exploit to victim**.
