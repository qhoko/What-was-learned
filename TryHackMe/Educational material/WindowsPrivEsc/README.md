# ü™ü Windows PrivEsc - Lab Description

## üìú Description
In this lab, you will learn privilege escalation techniques in Windows by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a specially designed virtual machine. The lab provides multiple ways to gain administrator or SYSTEM privileges using different exploitation methods.

## üéØ Objectives

### 1. Deploying a Vulnerable Windows VM
Set up a virtual machine with a vulnerable version of Windows to complete further privilege escalation tasks.

### 2. Generating a Reverse Shell Executable
Create an executable file that will establish a reverse connection to your terminal, allowing remote control of the system.

### 3. Service Exploitation - Insecure Service Permissions
Investigate and exploit vulnerabilities related to improperly configured service permissions, which could allow you to execute arbitrary code as a system user.

### 4. Service Exploitation - Incorrect Service Path (Unquoted Service Path)
Discover and exploit vulnerabilities in incorrectly specified service paths that can be used to execute malicious code.

### 5. Service Exploitation - Weak Registry Permissions
Investigate vulnerabilities in registry permissions that could allow you to make changes to the system and elevate your privileges.

### 6. Service Exploitation - Insecure Service Executables
Examine service executables that may be susceptible to replacement, enabling malicious code to run with elevated privileges.

### 7. Registry Vulnerabilities - AutoRuns
Analyze AutoRuns via the registry to identify programs and scripts that run automatically during system boot.

### 8. Registry Vulnerabilities - AlwaysInstallElevated
Study the "AlwaysInstallElevated" configuration, which allows installing programs with administrator rights and may be used for privilege escalation.

### 9. Passwords - Registry
Learn to find passwords and credentials stored in the registry, which can grant access to critical system resources.

### 10. Passwords - Saved Credentials
Work with saved credentials to analyze potential vulnerabilities and gain access to user accounts.

### 11. Passwords - Security Account Manager (SAM)
Study the SAM database to extract password hashes and use them to gain access to the system.

### 12. Passwords - Pass-the-Hash
Learn pass-the-hash techniques that allow authentication on systems without needing to enter plaintext passwords.

### 13. Task Schedulers
Explore vulnerabilities in task schedulers that could be used to execute malicious applications with administrator privileges.

### 14. Vulnerable GUI Applications
Identify vulnerable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can be exploited for privilege escalation on the target system.

### 15. Autoload Applications
Analyze applications that run automatically during system boot and search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

### 16. Token Impersonation - Rogue Potato
Use the Rogue Potato tool to impersonate tokens and elevate privileges within the system.

### 17. Token Impersonation - PrintSpoofer
Apply PrintSpoofer to obtain elevated tokens and execute malicious operations.

### 18. Privilege Escalation Scripts
Study and use various scripts that assist in the privilege escalation process, simplifying the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
