# 🐾 18. Privilege Escalation Scripts

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will use various tools to search for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities on Windows. The target machine contains four privilege escalation tools in the `C:\PrivEsc` directory:

- `winPEASany.exe`
- `Seatbelt.exe`
- `PowerUp.ps1`
- `SharpUp.exe`

We will run these tools and analyze the results to find possible privilege escalation opportunities.

## 🔍 Step 1: Run winPEASany
The first tool we will run is `winPEASany.exe`. This tool scans the system for various vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.

Run it with user privileges on the target machine:

'`C:\PrivEsc\winPEASany.exe`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- You will see a report containing a list of potential vulnerabilities on the target machine.
- Pay attention to results such as incorrect file permissions or vulnerabilities in installed applications.

## 🔍 Step 2: Run Seatbelt
Seatbelt is a tool for collecting system security information and searching for vulnerabilities. It helps you understand what security flaws could be exploited for privilege escalation.

Run it with user privileges:

'`C:\PrivEsc\Seatbelt.exe`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- You will receive a report with details about the system's security and potential vulnerabilities.

## 🔍 Step 3: Run PowerUp.ps1
PowerUp.ps1 is a PowerShell script for finding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can be used for privilege escalation.

Run it with administrator privileges:

'`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\PrivEsc\PowerUp.ps1`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- The script will display information about potential vulnerabilities, such as improperly configured file permissions or issues with services.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Run SharpUp.exe
SharpUp is a tool for finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities in Windows. It checks for vulnerable configurations and misconfigurations.

Run it with user privileges:

'`C:\PrivEsc\SharpUp.exe`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- You will receive a report showing potential vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited for privilege escalation.

## 📌 Notes
- Make sure to carefully analyze the reports from each tool to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
- These tools are useful for finding configuration errors and other weak points in the system.
