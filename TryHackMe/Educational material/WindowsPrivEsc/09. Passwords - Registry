# 🐾 Task 9: Passwords - Registry
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will search for passwords stored in the Windows registry. We will explore the registry for keys and values containing the word "password" and identify credentials for administrator autologin. Then, we will use the `winexe` command to obtain a command shell with administrator privileges.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Searching for Passwords in the Registry
First, search the registry for keys and values containing the word "password." Execute the following command:  
`reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you find keys or values containing the word "password."

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Finding Autologon Credentials
To save time, you can directly query a specific registry key that stores autologon credentials for the administrator. Execute the following command:  
`reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you find autologon credentials, including the username and password.

> ⚠️ If no password is found, you can try the default password `password123`.

## 📝 Step 3: Using `winexe` to Obtain a Command Shell
Now, use the `winexe` command on Kali to obtain a command shell with administrator privileges. Execute the following command (replace `password` with the password you found in the registry):  
`winexe -U 'admin%password123' //rhost cmd.exe`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you obtain a command shell with administrator privileges on the target machine.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully found passwords in the registry and used them to gain a command shell with administrator privileges! 🎊

## 📌 Notes
- In some cases, a password might not be found in the registry. If this happens, use the default password `password123`.
- Use this knowledge responsibly and only within authorized penetration testing engagements.
