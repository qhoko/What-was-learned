# 🐾 Task 12: Passwords - Using Hash for Authentication

Why crack a password hash if you can authenticate using the hash itself?

In this task, we will use the full hash of the administrator account to authenticate directly, bypassing the need for password cracking. This can be done using `pth-winexe` to spawn a shell with administrator privileges. The full hash includes both the LM and NTLM hashes, separated by a colon.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Prepare the Administrator Hash
Ensure that you have extracted the full hash of the administrator account. The hash should include both the LM and NTLM hashes, like this:  
`<LM_Hash>:<NTLM_Hash>`

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Authenticate Using `pth-winexe`
Use the `pth-winexe` command to authenticate and execute a command shell (`cmd.exe`) on the target machine with administrator privileges. Execute the following command, replacing `<hash>` with the full hash:

```bash
pth-winexe -U 'admin%<hash>' //10.10.1.124 cmd.exe

## 📋 Expected Output
You should gain a command shell with administrator privileges on the target machine without needing to crack the password.
## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully used the administrator's hash to authenticate and execute a command shell with administrator privileges! 🎊
