# 🐾 14. Insecure GUI Applications

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will use a vulnerable graphical user interface (GUI) application to execute commands with administrator privileges. We will start an RDP session with the "user" account, open the "AdminPaint" application which runs with administrator privileges, and use it to gain access to the command prompt with administrative rights.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Start an RDP session as "user"
First, connect to the target machine via RDP using the "user" account:

'`xfreerdp /u:user /p:password321 /cert:ignore /v:rhost`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that you have successfully connected to the target machine with the "user" account.

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Open the "AdminPaint" application
On the desktop, double-click the "AdminPaint" shortcut. After it opens, launch the command prompt and verify that Paint is running with administrator privileges:

'`tasklist /V | findstr mspaint.exe`'

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the "Paint" application is running with administrator privileges.

## 📝 Step 3: Open the command prompt with administrator privileges
In the Paint application, click the "File" menu, then choose "Open". In the file selection dialog, click the navigation field and paste the following path:

'`file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe`'

Press Enter to launch the command prompt with administrator privileges.

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the command prompt opens with administrator privileges and you gain access to the system.
